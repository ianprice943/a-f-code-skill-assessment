# Exercise 2

### Notes

- In order to handle an edge case of adding the same task twice, my form validation prevents both empty tasks and repeat tasks
- Step 4 of the features said that converting float based layouts to flexbox should not change the visuals, however making step 5 work properly did cause me to change the layout slightly on screens smaller than 600 pixels
