# Exercise 1

## To build and serve files to properly run in the browser:
1. run `npm install`
2. run `npm run build`
3. run `npm run start`

### A note on Exercise 1:
- Images URLs that come back from the API endpoint A&F provided are no longer valid, as such images do not load
- I have added alt text in lieu of the images not properly rendering
- I did not alter the createdAt time strings as I wasn't sure what would have been an appropriate format to use
- Styling was not mentioned, but I did add some basic styling and flexbox
